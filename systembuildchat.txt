ok so i need to create a new project for my wife.  i need a local ai assistant.  i will use ollama for this as it is for her work and i need the model to run local for her work privacy information.  i basically need a chat that can run on a browser so she can access it on her work laptop as she can not install any apps on her machine.  basically i just need a chat that has cut and paste maybe custom instructions.  it will mainly be used to do admin/logistic type work.  so emails and what not.  i would also like to be able to input The data input section will be like a rag for the LLM which will have like her works SOPs and blah blah blah whatnot. You get the gist. Let's brainstorm this out real quick before we build anything.  also i might need a good local model suggestion from ollama.  check my ollama setup.  i have 2 models in there.  the qwen one is nice because it is snappy...only 0.6b model....it thinks as well


Strategized local AI assistant design for wife's work



Great project idea! A local AI assistant for work with privacy requirements is definitely the right approach. Let me first check your current Ollama setup to see what models you have, then we can brainstorm the architecture.

D


execute_command



Architected local browser-based AI assistant with privacy focus.




Perfect! I can see you have two models:

gemma3n:e4b (7.5 GB) - More capable but heavier
qwen3:0.6b (522 MB) - Fast and lightweight as you mentioned
Let's brainstorm the architecture for your wife's local AI assistant:

Core Architecture Options
Option 1: Simple & Fast

Backend: Python FastAPI server that talks to Ollama
Frontend: Single-page web app (HTML/CSS/JS)
RAG: Simple file-based vector storage with embeddings
Model: Start with qwen3:0.6b for speed, upgrade to gemma3n if needed
Option 2: More Robust

Backend: Node.js/Express or Python Flask
Frontend: React/Vue for better UX
RAG: ChromaDB or similar for document storage
Multiple model support: Switch between models based on task
Key Features to Include:
Chat Interface: Clean, simple chat with history
Document Upload: Drag & drop for SOPs/work docs
Custom Instructions: Persistent system prompts
Export Options: Copy conversations, export to formats
Privacy: Everything stays local, no external calls
Model Recommendations:
For your use case, I'd suggest testing a few more options:

qwen2.5:7b - Good balance of speed/capability for admin work
llama3.1:8b - Excellent for business tasks
phi3:3.8b - Microsoft's model, great for office work
Would you prefer to start simple with a Python FastAPI backend, or do you have a preference for the tech stack? Also, what's your comfort level with different technologies?




so for now i am going to serve it on my macbook air m2.  the qwen model is fast but not as good as gemma:  i asked them both to create me a resume for Cobra Commander from GI Joe.  this is qwen response:  Cobra Commander from GI Joe – [Your Name]

Evaluated AI models for wife's work assistant, prioritizing context.
13s









Haha, that's a perfect test! The difference is crystal clear:

qwen3:0.6b: Completely missed the point - generic, boring resume that doesn't understand it's for a fictional villain gemma3n:e4b: Totally gets it - "Base of Operations: Cobra Island," "global domination," "advanced weaponry" - perfect!

For your wife's admin/logistics work, that contextual understanding from gemma3n will be crucial. She'll need an assistant that can:

Understand email tone and business context
Properly interpret SOPs and procedures
Follow complex multi-step instructions
Get the nuance in workplace communications
Recommendation: Start with gemma3n:e4b despite it being slower. For work tasks, accuracy > speed.

Proposed Simple Architecture:
Backend: Python FastAPI (lightweight, fast setup) Frontend: Clean HTML/CSS/JS (works in any browser) RAG: ChromaDB for document storage + embeddings Host: Your MacBook Air M2 (she accesses via browser)

Basic Features to Build:
Chat Interface: Clean conversation view
Document Upload: Drag & drop SOPs/work docs
Custom Instructions: Persistent system prompt
Conversation Export: Copy/save important chats
Simple RAG: Search uploaded documents
Want to start with a basic FastAPI + vanilla JS setup? I can help you build a minimal viable version first, then we can add features.

Also - have you tried qwen2.5:7b or llama3.1:8b? They might give you better performance/capability balance than the 0.6b model.

What's your Python comfort level?

i deleted qwen.. downloaded your suggestion...your thoughts:


Evaluated AI models, recommended gemma3n for work tasks.
10s







Interesting! phi3:3.8b definitely understands the assignment better than qwen, but it's... weird. It's trying to make Cobra Commander sound like a legitimate military contractor while still being villainous. Very different approach from gemma3n's clean, obvious villain resume.

Analysis:

gemma3n: Clean, accurate, stays in character perfectly
phi3:3.8b: Overly complex, mixing real-world/fiction awkwardly, but shows good detail and instruction following
For your wife's work assistant, this tells me:

phi3 might overthink simple requests
gemma3n is more direct and accurate
Both understand context way better than qwen
My recommendation: Test both with actual work-like prompts:

D


execute_command



Pondered model recommendation and testing strategy.


Let me suggest testing both models with work-relevant prompts like:

"Draft a professional email declining a meeting request"
"Summarize these SOP steps into a checklist"
"Help me prioritize these 5 tasks by urgency"
Based on the Cobra Commander test, I'm leaning toward gemma3n for work use - it's more precise and doesn't overcomplicate things.

For the architecture, let's go with:

Backend: Python FastAPI
Frontend: Clean HTML/CSS/JS  
RAG: ChromaDB for document embeddings
Model: gemma3n:e4b (with phi3 as backup option)
Want to start building? I can create:

Basic FastAPI server that talks to Ollama
Simple chat interface
Document upload for RAG
Custom instructions panel
Your Python comfort level? We can start with a minimal version and build up features incrementally.




i want the rag to be done only in a portion in the gui that the user can adjust...meaning a uploadable "knowledge" part.  i love my wife but i do not want to reprogram this everytime she needs a change.  so please start a new directory create a new directory on my desktop for this as i will need to keep it seporate form other ai

Okay, I like it. I don't know about the model but um, can you add in their memory and It's just make it more aesthetically pleasing and make it like have like pink tones and everything but kind of like dark mode So no like super white stuff Just you know see what you could do.  Also make it like right now if I'm looking like I have the browser open I can't really see the custom instructions nor can I actually like get to them to write anything maybe a little bit but kind of look at the the formatting and stuff and maybe make it like a collapsible settings tab like kind of like how Apple has everything set up like for the settings and everything so it would be kind of just the chat interface and then if the user wants to open something up they can go to the side and open it.
